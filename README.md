Key Features:
EC2 Instance Setup: Deployed and configured an EC2 instance to host the Todo application, providing a reliable and scalable environment.

Jenkins Integration: Installed and configured Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Jenkins was integrated with GitHub to automatically fetch and execute the latest code.

CI/CD Pipeline: Developed a Jenkins pipeline that automates continuous integration and deployment, ensuring seamless and fast updates to the application with minimal manual intervention.

Dockerization: Containerized the Todo application using Docker, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying scalability.

Automated Deployment: Configured Jenkins to automatically build Docker images and deploy containers, ensuring the application is always up-to-date with the latest changes.

GitHub Webhook Setup: Integrated GitHub webhooks to trigger automatic deployments whenever code changes are pushed, streamlining the deployment process and minimizing downtime.

Outcome:
The project resulted in the successful implementation of an automated CI/CD pipeline, allowing for instantaneous deployment of changes to the live application upon code modifications. This provides a reliable, scalable, and efficient deployment process for continuous delivery of the Node.js Todo application.
